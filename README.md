# An Introduction to Mockery: A Mocking Framework for PHP

This repository contains the code for The Engineering Coach YouTube video, "An Introduction to Mockery: A Mocking Framework for PHP".

In this tutorial, we demonstrate how to use the popular Mockery framework to replace our hand-coded Test Doubles from a previous video series. You'll see how a mocking framework streamlines your Test-Driven Development (TDD) workflow, making your tests more expressive and efficient.

## What You'll Learn

  - How to replace hand-coded test doubles with a powerful mocking framework.
  - The fundamental syntax and methods of Mockery.
  - The benefits of using a mocking framework for TDD.
  - How Mockery integrates with PHPUnit.

## Watch the Video Tutorial

This video is a great resource for anyone looking to optimize their testing workflow and move beyond the theory of test doubles.
